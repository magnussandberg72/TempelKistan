    <h2>📖 God’s Word on Giving & Tithing</h2>

    <p><strong>Mark 12:41–44</strong><br>
    “Jesus sat down opposite the temple treasury and watched the crowd putting their money into the offering boxes. 
    Many rich people threw in large amounts. 
    But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins, worth only a few cents. 
    Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, ‘Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others. 
    They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything—all she had to live on.’”</p>

    <p><strong>Malachi 3:10</strong><br>
    “Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. 
    Test me in this,” says the Lord Almighty, “and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven 
    and pour out so much blessing that there will not be room enough to store it.”</p>

    <p><strong>Proverbs 3:9–10</strong><br>
    “Honor the Lord with your wealth, with the firstfruits of all your crops; 
    then your barns will be filled to overflowing, and your vats will brim over with new wine.”</p>

    <p><strong>2 Corinthians 9:6–7</strong><br>
    “Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously. 
    Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, 
    for God loves a cheerful giver.”</p>

    <p><strong>Luke 6:38</strong><br>
    “Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, 
    will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.”</p>

    <p><strong>Acts 20:35</strong><br>
    “It is more blessed to give than to receive.”</p>
