      <h2>📜 About Word of Life</h2>
      <p><strong>Welcome home!</strong> Since the church Word of Life was founded on May 24, 1983, we have dreamed, built, and developed a church that loves Jesus and people.</p>
      <p>Word of Life is part of the Faith Movement and is a warm and outward-reaching congregation – a place where people of all ages can feel at home and included. We want everyone to be able to grow both as individuals and in their faith in Jesus.</p>
      <p>Our vision and work extend from Uppsala to the world. We work to make the love of Jesus accessible to as many people as possible – through worship services, missions, Bible schools, social work, and humanitarian aid.</p>
      <p>The call we received from the Lord at the beginning, which still guides us today, is these words:  
      <em>“Equip God’s people with His Word of faith. Show them their spiritual weapons. Teach them how to use them and send them out in victorious battle for the Lord.”</em></p>
      <p>The pastoral team consists of Pastor Christian Åkerhielm, Pastor Simon Ahlstrand, and Pastor Sebastian Asklund.  
      Over the years, Word of Life has established over a thousand churches internationally, run Bible schools, and carried out humanitarian work across the world.</p>

      <h2 style="margin-top:60px;">📜 About Hillsong Church Sweden</h2>
      <p>Hillsong Sweden is a local expression of Hillsong Church, dedicated to creating a welcoming and dynamic space where people can encounter God’s love.</p>
      <p>We are a community driven by a passion for Jesus, committed to authentic worship and focused on serving our local communities. We believe in the power of the local church to transform lives and bring hope to Sweden.</p>
      <p>We are located in Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malmö, Jönköping, and Örebro, and we are part of a global family of churches. We are a church that loves God and loves people – a place where you can belong, grow, and make a difference.</p>
      <p>Our focus is to build a community where people can experience God’s presence and discover their purpose.</p>

      <h3>✝️ Our Faith</h3>
      <p>We believe that the Bible is God’s Word – reliable and relevant to our lives. We believe in an eternal God existing in three Persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  
         We believe that Jesus Christ is the only way to reconciliation and eternal life, that He died and rose again for us.  
         We believe in baptism, the power of the Holy Spirit, the spiritual gifts, and the importance of the local church as a community of believers.</p>
      <p>We believe that God has called us to live holy and fruitful lives – blessed to be a blessing to others.  
         We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ will return, just as He promised.</p>
